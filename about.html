# About Me

I'm a second year undergraduate studying course 22 (nuclear science and engineering). I think energy in its many forms is fascinating, and I'm curious to explore innovative ways to harness it at the micro and macro scale. 
I'm also interested in the way people interact with and perceive energy. Why are some energy sources heavily stigmatized? Why is NIMBY so prevalent even among communities who claim to support that source of power? What are the legal policies governing our energy technologies and utilities, and how can those regulations be improved?
Outside of my formal studies, I'm incredibly passionate about sustainability in the realms of water and waste management. These areas present real and substantial challeneges that I feel are often overlooked due to their scale, complexity, and unappealing image.
Here at MIT I'm involved in: AFROTC, Addir, 7.012 TA, a UROP in the 22 department, McCormick HouseGov, and NEET.
When I'm not thinking about environmental sustainability, I love reading, playing soccer, figure skating, playing flute, growing plants, being outdoors, and baking.
