# My Week


## November 22 and 24


## LDR analog outputs

Using the LDR setup that I had already tested with the LED, I used one of the arduino example codes to read the outputs of my different LDR "sensors" numerically.
This gave me a better sense of what values the lower inside lights register, adn I compared the readings as I moved a flashlight around. I also used this to label each sensor and map it to an Analog input on the board.
It's important that I know which sensor corresponds to which quadrant, so that I can plan out code for moving the collector.

## 1 Motor

I then transitioned into actually using the sesnor data to drive a motor. Once again, drawing heavy insight from this freely available code: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/DemetrisEng/solar-tracker-35w-with-dc-motors-1b5ac6
I managed to get one motor working so that it would step constantly and change direction based on where I moved a flashlight.

## 2 Motors

I quickly ran into difficulty transitioning to two motors. I've been trying to trouble shoot and debug, but have yet to find the exact problem. 
I seem to only get one of the motors to step, but it does so in only one direction and with a very irregular rythm.
