# My Week


## November 29 through December 5


## Driving two motors

Using the LDR setup that I had already tested with the LED, I used one of the arduino example codes to read the outputs of my different LDR "sensors" numerically.
This gave me a better sense of what values the low interior lights register, and I compared the readings as I moved a flashlight around. I also used this to label each sensor and map it to an Analog input on the board.
It's important that I know which sensor corresponds to which quadrant, so that I can plan out code for moving the collector.

## changing breadboard layout

I then transitioned into actually using the sesnor data to drive a motor, once again drawing heavy insight from this freely available code: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/DemetrisEng/solar-tracker-35w-with-dc-motors-1b5ac6
Following the same logic structure as the example, I averaged the values of each side of the sensors (i.e average of the left sensors and average of the right sensors) then told the motor to step a certain direction depending on which side is larger and reverse if the other is larger. 
I managed to get one motor working so that it would step constantly and change direction based on where I moved a flashlight.

## Getting outdoor sensor measurements


## Cadding and cutting cross divider

I quickly ran into difficulty transitioning to two motors. I'm genuinely stumped on why the transition has been difficult since I essentially should have only needed to copy the same code and change the names of variables.
I also want to work out a better method of having the system move one motor at a time and a better system for telling the motors to just hold their position. 
The example that I've been following uses a different type of motor, so it becomes less useful in figuring out these specific nuances for stepper motors.
Hopefully, I'll eventually get them to a point where they're not be bouncing around constantly which will limit the interferrence from passing shadows, but I can't do this until the basic functions are working. 
I've been trying to troubleshoot and debug for the rest of the week, but have yet to find the exact problem. 
I seem to only get one of the motors to step, but it does so in only one direction and with a very irregular rhythm.
