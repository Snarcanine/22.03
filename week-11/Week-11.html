# My Week


## November 29 through final day


## Driving two motors

After debugging both software and hardware problems, I did finally get both motors to run and flip directions based on the correct light inputs. 
This was a useful proof of concept since we will have to modify slightly for the final version.


## Changing breadboard layout

I then swapped to having our stepper drivers on the full-length breadboard to allow room for all four that we would be using in our final setup. This wiring configuration makes wiring all the motors easier as I can have their layouts be identical and easily visible. 
This became essentially our final layout to what will be mounted on the base of the cooker.

## Getting outdoor sensor measurements

Gyalpo and I took some sensor readings outside to help get a better sense of what the ambient outdoor light reads on our sensors and to calibrate approporiately. 
While indoors during class we usually only see a max of around 180 on the readout, outside we got around 600 in the shade and 800-900 in midday sunlight. 
This is useful for us to clibrate the sensitivity for the sensors by changing the bounds which will make it move.

## Cadding and cutting cross divider

I cadded, cut, and assembled the cross divider piece for the sensors. This piece is designed to increase sensitivity by helping it more clearly isolate which quadrant is brightest. 
It will also hopefully help reduce errors from things like quickly passing shadows.

## Final mounted layout for all four motors

While Gyalpo finalized his code, I mounted the new wiring setup now with all four drivers and the additional wiring for microstepping.

## Conclusion
The final build day was definitely a little rushed, and I didn't really get much time to test the system with it actually attached to the whole build. 
The sensor array and some of the wiring also didn't quite make it to their ideal placements, but I think the end product was nevertheless pretty satisfying.
