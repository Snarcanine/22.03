# My Week

September 20:
Questions of the day: 
- What are some types of energy freely available?
- How can we harness those energy sources?
- What should we do with that harvested energy?

Brainstorming:
- Staircase of energy collecting steps
- Wind and Solar powered air/climate measuring station. Super small, low footprint to allow many to be set up inexpensively and quickly.
- Small wheels for personal transportation (i.e scooter, roller skaes, skate boards, etc) which generate a small amount of energy for safety lights/battery.
- Portable, solar camp stove
- Using sound energy from stress relief (yelling) to turn on soothing lights
- Stress ball squezing pumps/generates something?

September 22:
Questions/Focus of the day:
Why should I have a portfolio?
Begin narrowing project ideas.

Step energy generation:
- Consider power density/efficiency
- would this make a stairwell more difficult for everday users? Would that lessen the number of people using it?
- What exactly do we want to power? Small display board, realtime analytics for users to interact with and observe?
