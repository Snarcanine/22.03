# My Week

September 27:
Divided into three groups: Collection, Storage, and Use

Brainstorming from "Use" group:

- Add drive system/phone dock to blue bikes
- Shower station for homeless
    - How much heat is needed for 5min shower?
        - 60 liters of water, heated to 40 degrees celsius. 
        - Heating water at 4kj/degree C*liter
        - Assuming cold tap water is around 16 degrees celsius
        - 5,760 total kJ or 19.2 kW when spanning 5 minutes
        - This is in a pretty reasonable middle range for a water heater which can run anywhere between 8 and 30 kW 
        - Heating water is an inevitably power-hungry process, but it's not unreasonable and load could perhaps be spread out by keeping the water at a lukewarm temp consistantly then finishing the heating immediately before use.
- Sensor network for smarter light or water saving 
- Tunnel system map using light to transmit current location
- Heater for bus stops 
- Hot water heater for communal fountains
- Small window AC?cooling unit using nontypical energy source
- Lamps for students
- Beverage warmer that acts as coaster and keeps warm from the bottom

September 29:
Narrowing down to specific project idea

What we have so far:

Potential users: MIT population or homeless
Potential sources: Solar, wind, compost, kinetic
Potential Storage: Hydrogen fuel cells, water tanks

Project idea: Renewable cooker/heater that can provide heat even when sun isn't out.

Research questions: 

- Precedence for renewable, on-demand cooking?
- What temperature ranges are useful?
- How are we delivering this heat? Conduction, convection, radiation? Stovetop, oven, broiler, grill, pressure cooker?
- Heat storage medium?
