# My Week


## October 4:


## Questions worked on by "Cooking" group:


- What will our primary cooking method be?
    - We opted for a flattop grill/stove because it allows the most flexibility in what we cook. It can act as both a direct griddle and a large burner to heat pans/pots on.
- Should there be an outlet for overflow energy after primary storage is full? What might this secondary storage be and what would its use be?
    - Though this isn't immediately within our group's area, we do think there should be some sort of secondary power storage/sink for times when we can gather excess energy and the primary storage fills up.
    - Our proposal is a small stirling generator that rests on top of the main storage and uses the excess heat once the salt is fully liquid to fill a battery. This battery can then power an overhead light and potential other systems.
- Will we need to modulate or precisely control heat during cooking, and how will we do this?
    - To determine the range of temperatures we would need and to better understand how much we may need to vary those temperatures in a single cooking session, we used theoretical test meals and discussed what we would need to cook these meals.
    - This revealed needing the capability to obtain high enough temperature to brown meat (around 400 F), the need to boil water (212 F) and decrease to a simmer (around 185 F), and the need to saute without scorching our cooking oil (around 200 F)
    - We also proposed that it would be useful to have areas of the cooktop at different temperatures. For example, a main really hot section for browning and boiling and then a side area for simmering or sauteing. This could be done by simply having the cooler side further from our heatpipes/source.
- Should we allow for a cover to convert to a sort of oven?
    - We determined it would be fairly easy to add a lid on a hinge similar to that of a barbeque to enable oven-like use.
