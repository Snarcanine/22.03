# My Week


## October 13:


## Ongoing design concerns for project integration:


- Heat transfer options:
    1. Shifting solid conduit/insulators into and out of alignment 
        -Pros: No electricity
        -Cons: Moving parts add complexity, less user friendly
    2. Liquid piping 
        - Pros:No moving parts, potentially easier to have heat gradient
        - Cons:Finding appropriate liquid medium that is stable and won't decay/corrode, need to integrate a pumping mechanism (likely requires electricity)
- Electricity generation:
    - Stirling generator
        - Output?
        - Resiliency and temperature range of functionality?
    - Alternatives?
        - Steam engine? Would require water being added, need to contain pressure, and may add additional danger/noise which is unwanted. 
        - No other feasible alternatives at this time.
- Solar tracking
    - Mechanical vs. Automated.
    - We've settled on automated which will require additional electrocity and systems. We're forming a solar tracking task group.
- Beginning to layout total grill system:
    - Where will the capture system go in relation to the rest of the systems?
        - Based on conversation with the capture team, the reflectors cannot be mounted above the grill. Mounted either below or on same plane as storage.
- Current limiting factors:
    - Storage capacity? Storage team is working on calculating total heat capacity of our two salt boxes.


## My area of focus: Electrical system and stirling engine

![alternate text: Introduction to Stirling Engines](./StirlingInfo.JPG)

At its most basic, a stirling engine uses a temperature difference between two ends of a sealed chamber to drive a piston. This has a couple benefits for our specific application. 
1. the working fluid (a gas like air or helium) remains in a sealed chamber and has no need to be refreshed or refilled. (when using a gas like hydrogen there may be some escape through diffusion, but this won't be applicable in our case)
2. The engine's efficiency and ability to function depends solely on the temperature difference between our hot and cold region, so we should be able to run it even with the substantial heat from our storage box so long as we can keep the "cold" end at a satisfactory temp.
3. A bigger tmeperature delta actually increases the engine efficiency (as does increasing pressure within the containment chamber, but we may not want to deal with that)
4. They are quite quiet compared to other alternatives which should increase our user-friendliness


A couple downsides to using a stirling engine include:
1. They tend to be somewhat heavy proportional to their power output. This makes them less feasible for anything that needs to be transported, but shouldn't be a major barrier in our case.
2. You cannot easily adjust or modulate power output. They are best used as a constant speed engine. I'm a little unsure whether this will be a substantial downside or not as I don't yet know the expected power demands of our electrical systems.
3. In some very rare cases, using air as the working fluid while also having it in contact with flammable substance such as lubricating oil can lead to an explosion hazard due to the high partial pressure of oxygen. I think this can fairly easily be avoided in our engine though.


There are three main configuration types for a stirling engine:

Stirling engine design focuses:


- Minimize friction
- Minimize dead space
- Learn how to calculate and quantify power output
- Decide on power conversion system (Piston, flywheel, diaphragm, etc.) and how it will interconnect with rest of electrial system. (do we want a battery, do we need to alter current, or have direct transmission?)
