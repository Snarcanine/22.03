# My Week


## October 13:


## Ongoing design concerns for project integration:


- Heat transfer options:
    - 1. Shifting solid conduit/insulators into and out of alignment 
        -Pros: No electricity
        -Cons: Moving parts add complexity, less user friendly
    - 2. Liquid piping 
        -Pros: No moving parts, potentially easier to have heat gradient
        -Cons: Finding appropriate liquid medium that is stable and won't decay/corrode, need to integrate a pumping mechanism (likely requires electricity)
- Electricity generation:
    - Stirling generator
        -Output?
        -Resiliency and temperature range of functionality?
    - Alternatives?
        -Steam engine? Would require water being added, need to contain pressure, and may add additional danger/noise which is unwanted. 
        -No other feasible alternatives at this time.
- Solar tracking
    -Mechanical vs. Automated.
    -We've settled on automated which will require additional electrocity and systems. We're forming a solar tracking task group.
- Beginning to layout total grill system:
    -Where will the capture system go in relation to the rest of the systems?
        -Based on conversation with the capture team, the reflectors cannot be mounted above the grill. Mounted either below or on same plane as storage.
- Current limiting factors:
    - Storage capacity? Storage team is working on calculating total heat capacity of our two salt boxes.
