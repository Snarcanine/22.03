# My Week


### October 18:


## Lingering questions from groups:


- Storage capacity of salt box
- Solar tracking mechanism
- Liquid vs. solid heat transfer to grill
- General layout of pieces
- Get teams into fusion360 (now completed)


## Next steps of Stirling engine/electrical system:


- Look into commercial stirling engine designs, yield calculations, and advancements.
- Is there something we can buy and modify or will our engine be scratch built?


## Integration team addresses solar tracking:


We considered two options: 


1. Tracking with a solar calculator which moves the collector steadily based on predetermined calculations for the location.
2. Tracking with a sensor array which finds brightest point in sky and steadily adjusts to stay pointed at it.
