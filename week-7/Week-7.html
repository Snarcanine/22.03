# My Week

## October 25:


Day's objectives:


- Ensure fusion model now approximately has size and placement of pieces
- For enclosure design address: height, handicap accessibility, spacing of cook surfaces.
- We decided on shifting from one large hot cooktop to two "burners" because the heat and energy waste from the open surface was substantial
- Other design touches to enhance user experience like smoothly rounded corners, hooks or other storage built in, countertop space.
