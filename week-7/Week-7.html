# My Week

## October 25:


Day's objectives:


- Ensure fusion model now approximately has size and placement of pieces
- For enclosure design address: height, handicap accessibility, spacing of cook surfaces.
- We decided on shifting from one large hot cooktop to two "burners" because the heat and energy waste from the open surface was substantial
- Other design touches to enhance user experience like smoothly rounded corners, hooks or other storage built in, countertop space.

## October 27:

Things to-do in preparation for Mid-review 


- User controls (heat modulation, lights, etc.)
- Mounting the collector above the cooker--framework+awning 
- Lid/cover for the cooktop when not in use
- Electrical systems


The design for the heat controls will depend heavily on the physical limitations of the storage team's transfer mechanism. Here's an idealized layout for what they may look like.

We want to minimize the total footprint of our installation which means mounting the solar collector above the cooker. Our current estimate on the collector's size has a 6.5 foot diameter, so it is vastly larger than the cooker itslef.
To allow for solar tracking, we debated between rotating it via a single ball joint and two moving point or using a rotating base and pivoting up/down like a turret does.

We ultimately settled on the turret design for moving our collector, so now we need to decide on how to mount it above the cooker. 
The circular turret base needs to be directly supported which lends to the entire frame being circular. It's also important that the sun tunnel get some support from the frame. 
To increase user friedliness and hopefully aesthetics. We decided to incorporate and awning into the support framework.
I want to minimize the weight from the "awning" portion as much as possible, so I'm thinking of using a really durable fabric rather than something solid.

In dealing with the frame that supports the collector and sun tunnel, I've been thinking more about the sun tunnel itself and the potential energy loss it incurs. We've been working under the assumption that it's losses will be minimal, but we're going to need an incredibly reflective coating/material for its interior lining.

Such coatings do exists and are called multilayer dielectric HR coatings? I was also wondering if placing a lens in the solar tunnel near the top and beginning would help at all with recapturing scatter?
