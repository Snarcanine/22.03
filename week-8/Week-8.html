# My Week

## October 25:


Day's objectives:


- Ensure fusion model now approximately has size and placement of pieces
- For enclosure design address: height, handicap accessibility, spacing of cook surfaces.
- We decided on shifting from one large hot cooktop to two "burners" because the heat and energy waste from the open surface was substantial
- Other design touches to enhance user experience like smoothly rounded corners, hooks or other storage built in, countertop space.

## October 27:

Things to-do in preparation for Mid-review 


- User controls (heat modulation, lights, etc.)
- Mounting the collector above the cooker--framework+awning 
- Lid/cover for the cooktop when not in use
- Electrical systems


The design for the heat controls will depend heavily on the physical limitations of the storage team's transfer mechanism. Here's an idealized layout for what they may look like.

We want to minimize the total footprint of our installation which means mounting the solar collector above the cooker. Our current estimate on the collector's size has a 6.5 foot diameter, so it is vastly larger than the cooker itslef.
To allow for solar tracking, we debated between rotating it via a single ball joint and two moving point or using a rotating base and pivoting up/down like a turret does.

We ultimately settled on the turret design for moving our collector, so now we need to decide on how to mount it above the cooker. 
The circular turret base needs to be directly supported which lends to the entire frame being circular. It's also important that the sun tunnel get some support from the frame. 
To increase user friedliness and hopefully aesthetics. We decided to incorporate and awning into the support framework.
I want to minimize the weight from the "awning" portion as much as possible, so I'm thinking of using a really durable fabric rather than something solid.

In dealing with the frame that supports the collector and sun tunnel, I've been thinking more about the sun tunnel itself and the potential energy loss it incurs. We've been working under the assumption that it's losses will be minimal, but we're going to need an incredibly reflective coating/material for its interior lining.
As you can see from the below graphic, Mylar which is at most about 95% reflective may be insufficient for our sun tunnel.

Incredibly high reflectivity coatings do exist and are called multilayer dielectric HR coatings, but they are specified to very small wavelenth bands usually only varying by around 5 nm. When put over a metallic mirror, dielectric overcoats also handling of metallic mirrors, increase the durability of the metal coating, provide protection from oxidation, and enhance the reflectance of the metal coating in specific spectral regions.
For the best results we could combine a highly reflective metal coating with a dielectric HR coating in a common wavelength in sunlight's spectrum (around 500 nm). This is probably not feasible to our project without significant cost and custom ordering however.

Hanging questions:


- Would placing a lens in the solar tunnel near the top and bottom help at all with recapturing scatter and increasing efficiency of total tunnel?
- What happens when rain falls down the solar tunnel? Will the be any way to access the inside for cleaning/draining?
- How big does our rotating turret base need to be?
- Would routing the sun tunnel in through the side of the enclosure rather than the back be beneficial since then it might make attaching lid/clover to back easier?
- Could we thin the depth from 24 inches to 18 inches? Probably not worth it since extra space on cooker enclosure is not the concern when it comes to footprint minimization.
