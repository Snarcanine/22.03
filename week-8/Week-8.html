# My Week

## November 8:


Project Pivot and the new plan:


- All groups will downsize/simplify their systems with the end goal of producing a much smaller scale, less complex prototype that actually functions.
- For Tracking team:
	- System redesign to eliminate solar tunnel
	- Our Capture tracking system will now be mounted to the ground rather than above the storage. 
	- The storage box will be mounted to the rotating base of our altazimuth mount and will have a simplified insulation and heat transfer mechanism.
	- Focus on detailed and functional CAD model for the altazimuth mount and new base. 


New sketches for simplified design:

Weed needed to offset the point where the rotation bar attaches to the collector to allow reflected light down through the center hole.
We opted to drive the rotation bar with a belt drive system due to increased cost efficiency, simplicity, and assumptions surrounding the collector that its mass would not be substantial enough to make back drive a major concern.

Having to mount the storage box to the actual rotating base provided several orientation problems. 
The beam of sunlight directed into storage is going to change throughout the day as the dish rotates which reduces transfer if not hitting perpedicular to collection surface.
We also still need to be able to cook/extract heat from the top, so out incoming sun could either be directed into the side or the bottom of the box.



## November 10:

Focuses: Rotating base Model design and material selection.

A Top-down view of our base gear assembly:

Side views of base assembly:

In these images, the green and pink rings rotate while the orange and blue are static. The blocks supporting the green ring in the cad model will be roller ball casters to allow for rotation and support weight.
I specifically helped with updating the spur gear (small coral gear) and outer gear (large pink gear). These changes included using odd amounts of teeth to prevent uneven wearing, increasing surface area contact between teeth, and using smaller teeth to make driving the system easier.
